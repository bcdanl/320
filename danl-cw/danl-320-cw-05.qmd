The `nfl.csv` file contains a list of players in the National Football League with similar `Name`, `Team`, `Position`, `Birthday`, and `Salary` variables in the `nba.csv` file. 



```{python}
#| echo: true
import pandas as pd
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
df = pd.read_csv("https://bcdanl.github.io/data/nfl.csv")
nfl = spark.createDataFrame(df)
```


```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| message: false
DT:::datatable(readr::read_csv('https://bcdanl.github.io/data/nfl.csv'), 
          extensions = c('Buttons','FixedColumns'),
          options = list(
            dom = 'Bfrtip',
            buttons = c('csv'),
            scrollX = TRUE,
            fixedColumns = list(leftColumns = 2)
            ), 
          elementId = "exampleTable"
          )
