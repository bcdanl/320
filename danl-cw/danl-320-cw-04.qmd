## Question 3


```{python}
#| echo: true
fare = "$10.00"
tip = "2.00$"

#| echo: true
list_variable = [100, 144, 169, 1000, 8]
```


Write a Python code that uses `print()` and `max()` functions to print out the largest value in the list, `list_variable`, as follows:

<div style="font-family:courier">The largest value in the list is: 1000</div>

<br>

*Answer*

```{python}

```



<br><br><br>
## Question 6
- Assign the value 7 to the variable `guess_me`, and the value 1 to the variable `number`. 

- Write a `while` loop that compares `number` with `guess_me.` 
  - Print 'too low' if `number` is less than guess me. 
  - If `number` equals `guess_me`, print 'found it!' and then exit the loop. 
  - If `number` is greater than `guess_me`, print 'oops' and then exit the loop. 
  - Increment `number` at the end of the loop.

- Write a `for` loop that compares `number` with `guess_me.` 
  - Print 'too low' if `number` is less than guess me. 
  - If `number` equals `guess_me`, print 'found it!' and then exit the loop. 
  - If `number` is greater than `guess_me`, print 'oops' and then exit the loop. 
  - Increment `number` at the end of the loop.

- Write a Python program to:
	1.	Attempt to convert value to a floating-point number using `float()`.
	2.	If the conversion is successful, print: "You entered: <number>".
	3.	If the conversion fails (e.g., the value is not a valid number), print: "That's not a valid number!".

- Use a try-except block to handle the potential error.
