The `netflix.csv` file (with its pathname `https://bcdanl.github.io/data/netflix.csv`) contains a list of 6,000 titles that were available to watch in November 2019 on the video streaming service Netflix. It includes four variables: the videoâ€™s `title`, `director`, the date Netflix added it (`date_added`), and its `type` (category). 


```{python}
#| echo: true
import pandas as pd
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
df = pd.read_csv("https://bcdanl.github.io/data/netflix.csv")
df = df.where(pd.notnull(df), None)
netflix = spark.createDataFrame(df)
```



```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: false
DT:::datatable(readr::read_csv('https://bcdanl.github.io/data/netflix.csv')
          )
```
