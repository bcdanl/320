# Direction

- Please submit your **Jupyter Notebook** for **Part 1 in Homework 2** to Brightspace with the name below:

  - `danl-320-hw2-LASTNAME-FIRSTNAME.ipynb`\
  ( e.g., `danl-320-hw2-choe-byeonghak.ipynb` )

- The due is March 24, 2025, 3:15 P.M.

# Part 1. Linear Regression

Consider the `beer_markets`
```{.python}
beer_markets = pd.read_csv(
  'https://bcdanl.github.io/data/beer_markets_all.csv'
)
```


```{r}
#| echo: false
#| eval: true

DT::datatable(readr::read_csv('https://bcdanl.github.io/data/beer_markets_all.csv'))
```

<br>

<br><br>

## Question 1
Create the DataFrame that keeps all the observations  whose value of `container` is either 'CAN' or 'NON REFILLABLE BOTTLE' in the `beer_markets` DataFrame.

<br>

## Question 2
Split the resulting data.frame of Question 1 into training and test DataFrames such that approximately 67% of observations in the resulting DataFrame of Question 1 belong to the training DataFrame and the rest observations belong to the test DataFrame.


<br>


## Questions 3-8
Consider the following three linear regression models:

### Model 1

$$
\begin{aligned}
\log(\text{price\_per\_floz}) = &\ \beta_{0} + \sum_{i=1}^{N} \beta_{i} \,\text{market}_{i} + \sum_{j=N+1}^{N+4} \beta_{j} \,\text{brand}_{j}
+ \beta_{N+5} \,\text{container\_CAN} \\ 
&\,+\, \beta_{N+6} \log(\text{beer\_floz}) + \epsilon
\end{aligned}
$$

### Model 2

$$
\begin{aligned}
\log(\text{price\_per\_floz}) \,=\, & \beta_{0} \,+\, \sum_{i=1}^{N}\beta_{i}\,\text{market}_{i} \,+\, \sum_{j=N+1}^{N+4}\beta_{j}\,\text{brand}_{j} \,+\, \beta_{N+5}\,\text{container\_CAN} \\
&\,+\, \beta_{N+6}\log(\text{beer\_floz})\\
&\,+\, \sum_{j=N+1}^{N+4}\beta_{j\times\text{beer\_floz}}\,\text{brand}_{j}\times \log(\text{beer\_floz})\\
&\,+\, \epsilon
\end{aligned}
$$


### Model 3

$$
\begin{aligned}
\log(\text{price\_per\_floz}) \,=\, & \beta_{0} \,+\, \sum_{i=1}^{N}\beta_{i}\,\text{market}_{i} \,+\, \sum_{j=N+1}^{N+4}\beta_{j}\,\text{brand}_{j} \,+\, \beta_{N+5}\,\text{container\_CAN} \\
&\,+\, \beta_{N+6}\log(\text{beer\_floz})\\
&\,+\, \beta_{N+7}\,\text{promo} \times\log(\text{beer\_floz}) \\
&\,+\, \sum_{j=N+1}^{N+4}\beta_{j\times\text{beer\_floz}}\,\text{brand}_{j}\times \log(\text{beer\_floz})\\
&\,+\, \sum_{j=N+1}^{N+4}\beta_{j\times\text{promo}}\,\text{brand}_{j}\times \text{promo}\\
&\,+\, \sum_{j=N+1}^{N+4}\beta_{j\times\text{promo}\times\text{beer\_floz}}\,\text{brand}_{j}\times \text{promo}\times \log(\text{beer\_floz})\\
&\,+\, \epsilon
\end{aligned}
$$

- Set "**BUD LIGHT**" as the reference level for the $\text{brand}$ variable.
- Set "**BUFFALO-ROCHESTER**" as the reference level for the $\text{market}$ variable.. 
  - There are $N+1$ distinct categories in the $\text{market}$ variable.

<br><br>




### Question 3
Provide intuition behind each of the model.


<br><br>


### Question 4
- Train each of the three linear regression models using the training DataFrame from Question 2.
  - Provide the summary of the result for each linear regression model.
  - What are the predicted beer prices for unseen data from each model?

<br><br>

### Question 5
- Interpret the beta estimates of the following variables from the Model 3:
  1. `market_ALBANY`
  2. `market_EXURBAN NY`
  3. `market_RURAL NEW YORK`
  4. `market_SURBURBAN NY`
  5. `market_SYRACUSE`
  6. `market_URBAN NY`

<br><br>


### Question 6
- Across the three models, how is the percentage change in the price of beer sensitive to the percentage change in the volume of beer purchases for each brand? 

- How does `promo` affect such sensitivity in the Model 3?


<br><br>

### Question 7
- Draw a residual plot from each of the three models.
  - On average, are the prediction correct? Are there systematic errors?


<br><br>


### Question 8
Which model do you prefer most and why?

<br><br>
