Consider the `homes` DataFrame from the 2004 American Housing Survey, which includes data on home values, demographics, schools, income, finance, mortgages, sales, neighborhood characteristics, noise, smells, state geography, and urban classification.

```{.python}
homes = pd.read_csv(
  'https://bcdanl.github.io/data/american_housing_survey.csv'
)
```


```{r}
#| echo: false
#| eval: true

DT::datatable(readr::read_csv('https://bcdanl.github.io/data/american_housing_survey.csv'))
```

## Question 1
Plot some relationships and tell a story.

<br>

## Question 2
- Fit a **linear regression model** with the following specifications:
  - **Outcome variable**: $\log(VALUE)$
  - **Predictors**: all but `AMORT` and `LPRICE`

<br>

## Question 3
- Refit the **linear regression model**, retaining only statistically significant predictors from Question 1. 
- Compare the revised model to the initial model from **Question 2** using:
	-	$\beta$ estimates
	-	$R^2$
	-	RMSE
	-	Residual plots

<br>

## Question 4
- Fit a **logistic regression model** with the following specifications:
  - **Outcome variable**: $\text{GT20DWN}$ (indicating whether the buyer made a down payment of 20% or more)
  - **Predictors**: All available variables except `AMORT` and `LPRICE`

- The outcome variable is defined as:
$$
\begin{align}
\text{GT20DWN} \,=\,\begin{cases}
1 & \text{if}\; \frac{\text{LPRICE} - \text{AMMORT}}{\text{LPRICE}} > 0.2 \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\end{align}
$$

-	Analyze and interpret the following relationships:
  - The association between **first-time homeownership** ($\text{FRSTHO}$) and the probability of making a 20%+ down payment.
  - The association between **number of bedrooms** ($\text{BEDRMS}$) and the probability of making a 20%+ down payment.

<br>



## Question 5
-	Refit the **logistic regression model**, adding interaction terms:
  - **Predictors**: all previously included predictors in Question 4 **plus** the interaction between $\text{FRSTHO}$ and $\text{BEDRMS}$

- Interpret how the relationship between BEDRMS and the probability of a 20%+ down payment varies depending on whether the buyer is a first-time homeowner ($\text{FRSTHO}$). 

<br>



## Question 6
-	Fit separate **logistic regression models** (similar to Question 4) for two subsets of homes:
  1. **Homes worth** $\text{VALUE} \geq 175k$. 
  2. **Homes worth** $\text{VALUE} < 175k$. 
- Compare residual deviance, $RMSE$, and classification performance.
