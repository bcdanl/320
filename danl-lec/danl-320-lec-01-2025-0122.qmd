## Installing the Tools
### R Packages and `tidyverse`

- **R packages** are collections of R functions, compiled code, and data that are combined in a structured format.

- The `tidyverse` is a collection of R packages designed for data science that share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures. 
  - The `tidyverse` packages work harmoniously together to make data manipulation, exploration, and visualization more.
  - We will use several R packages from `tidyverse` throughout the course. (e.g., `ggplot2`, `dplyr`, `tidyr`)



## Installing the Tools
### Installing R packages with `install.packages("packageName")`

- R packages can be easily installed from within R using functions  `install.packages("packageName")`. 
  - To install the R package `tidyverse`, type and run the following from R console:

```{.r}
install.packages("tidyverse")
```


- While running the above codes, you may encounter the question below from the R Console:


:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}

- **Mac**: *"Do you want to install from sources the packages which need compilation?"* from Console Pane.
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

- **Windows**: *"Would you like to use a personal library instead?"* from Pop-up message.
:::
::::

- Type `no` in the R Console, and then hit *Enter*.



## Installing the Tools
### Loading R packages with `library(packageName)`

- Once installed, a package is loaded into an R session using `library(packageName)` so that its functions and data can be used.
  - To load the R package `tidyverse`, type and run the following command from a R script:

```{.r}
library(tidyverse)
df_mpg <- mpg
```


- `mpg` is the data.frame provided by the R package `ggplot2`, one of the R pakcages in `tidyverse`.



## Installing the Tools 
### Python in RStudio

::: {.panel-tabset}
## Python Option 

- We can run Python codes within RStudio.

- Select Python interpreter in RStudio from **Tools** $>$ **Global Options** $>$ **Python**:

## R package, `reticulate`

- Install the R package, `reticulate`
```{.r}
install.packages("reticulate")
```

- This package allows `Quarto` to use Python and R objects interactively within one Quarto document.

- An YAML (yet another markup language) header surrounded by `---`.
  - It is commonly used for document configuration (e.g., title, author, date, style, ...).

- Chunks of Python/R code surrounded by three backticks, $\text{```}$.

## Getting Started with Quarto
### Knitting / Rendering

- When we knit the document, Quarto sends the `.qmd` file to **jupyter**/**knitr**, which executes all of the code chunks and creates a new markdown (`.md`) document which includes the code and its output. 

- The markdown file (`*.md`) generated by **jupyter**/**knitr** is then processed by **pandoc**, which is responsible for creating the output file.

## Getting Started with Quarto
### Markdown, Quarto, and HTML

- The very original version of **Markdown** was invented mainly to write HTML content more easily.
  - For example, `- SOME_TEXT` in "*.md" is equivalent to `<ul><li> SOME_TEXT </li>` in "*.html"
  
  
- Pandoc makes it possible to convert a Markdown document to a large variety of output formats, such as HTML.



## Getting Started with Quarto and HTML
### Markdown, Quarto, and HTML


```{.bash}
---
title: "Habits"
author: YOUR_NAME
date: January 30, 2024
format: 
  html
---
```




- To create an HTML document from Quarto, we specify the `html` output format in the YAML metadata of our document.
  - By default, `format: html` is set.

- In RStudio, we can create a new Quarto file from the menu, File -> New File -> Quarto Document.

- Open an empty Quarto file.
  - Type the following YAML metadata to the empty Quarto file.





## Getting Started with Quarto
### Quarto Basics


- In RStudio, close the project `USERNAME.github.io.Rporj` if it is on.
  1. Click `USERNAME.github.io.Rporj` at the top-right corner.
  2. Click *Close Project*.
  

- Download the Quarto file, `danl-320-quarto-r.qmd` from Brightspace, and open it from RStudio.




## Getting Started with Quarto
### Quarto Basics

```{.bash}
---
title: 
subtitle: 
author: 
date: last-modified

format: 
  html:
  
execute: 
  echo: true
  eval: true
---
```



- The following syntax is part of YAML metadata in `danl-320-quarto-r.qmd`.
  - In YAML, indentation really matters!
  - **tab** (or four spaces) defines a level in YAML.


# Managing a Website with Quarto (and Jupyter Notebook) {background-color="#1c4982"}

## Quarto Websites


- In RStudio, open the project `USERNAME.github.io.Rporj`.
  1. Click `Project: (None)` at the top-right corner.
  2. Click `USERNAME.github.io.Rporj`.


- Your website has a `_quarto.yml` configuration file.
  - This file provides options for HTML documents within the website.


:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
```{.bash}
---
project:
  type: website

website:
  title: "YOUR NAME"
  navbar:
    left:
      - text: Project
        href: project.qmd
      - text: Blog
        href: blog-listing.qmd
```

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

```{.bash}
format:
  html:
    theme: cosmo
    css: styles.css
    toc: false
---
```

- The `_quarto.yml` file configures the website settings.

- Indentation matters!

## Quarto Websites
### Custom CSS

- Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is used to format the layout of a webpage (color, font, text size, background, display, etc.). 

  - HTML will format the architecture of the house.
  
  - CSS will be the carpet and walls to decorate the house.
  
  - JavaScript adds interactive elements in the house, such as opening doors and lighting.

  
- We are not front-end web developers. 

  - We will not cover the use of CSS and JavaScript.



## Quarto Websites
### Rendering

- The **Render** button (**command/Ctrl + shift + K**) renders a single Quarto file.

- `quarto render` from Terminal renders all Quarto/Jupyter Notebook files in your local working directory:

```{.bash}
quarto render
```

- We should use `quarto render` when we have changes in `_quarto.yml`.

- Make changes only from your local laptop. 
  - Do not make any change from the GitHub repo webpage.




## Quarto Websites
### Adding `*.ipynb` to Quarto websites


- By default, `quarto render` doesn’t execute any code in `.ipynb` notebooks. 

- `quarto render` renders `.ipynb` notebooks, so that corresponding `html` files are rendered. 

  - If we need to update cell outputs in `*.ipynb`, run that `*.ipynb` on Google Colab, and save the notebook.




## Quarto Websites
### Appearance and Style

- `theme` specifies the Bootstrap theme to use for the page (themes are drawn from the [Bootswatch](https://bootswatch.com) theme library).
  - Valid themes include `default`, `bootstrap`, `cerulean`, `cosmo`, `darkly`, `flatly`, `journal`, `lumen`, `paper`, `readable`, `sandstone`, `simplex`, `spacelab`, `united`, and `yeti`. 

  
- `highlight-style` specifies the code highlighting style. 
  - Supported styles include `default`, `tango`, `pygments`, `kate`, `monochrome`, `espresso`, `zenburn`, `haddock`, `breezedark`, and `textmate`. 



## Quarto Websites

```{.bash}
left:
- text: Project
  href: project.qmd
- text: Blog
  href: blog-listing.qmd
- text: Homeowrk
  href: hw.qmd
```




## Quarto Websites

  - text: "Projects"
    menu:
      - project_1.qmd
      - project_2.qmd 
```


- More details about navbar are available here:
