# Big Data {background-color="#1c4982"}


## Big Data

- Big data and analytics are likely to be significant components of future careers across various fields.

- Big data refers to enormous and complex data collections that traditional data management tools can't handle effectively.

- Five key characteristics of big data (5 V's):
  1. Volume
  2. Velocity
  3. Value
  4. Veracity
  5. Variety


## Big Data
### 1. Volume
  - In 2017, the digital universe contained an estimated 16.1 zettabytes of data.
  - Expected to grow to 163 zettabytes by 2025.
  - Much new data will come from embedded systems in smart devices.

## Big Data
### 1. Volume

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="42%"}

| Name | Symbol | Value |
|------|--------|-------|
| Kilobyte | kB | 10³ |
| Megabyte | MB | 10⁶ |
| Gigabyte | GB | 10⁹ |
| Terabyte | TB | 10¹² |
| Petabyte | PB | 10¹⁵ |
| Exabyte | EB | 10¹⁸ |
| Zettabyte | ZB | 10²¹ |
| Yottabyte | YB | 10²⁴ |
| Brontobyte* | BB | 10²⁷ |
| Gegobyte* | GeB | 10³⁰ |

Note: The asterisks (*) next to Brontobyte and Gegobyte in the original image have been preserved in this table. These likely indicate that these units are less commonly used or are proposed extensions to the standard system of byte units.

## Big Data
### 2. Velocity
  - Refers to the rate at which new data is generated.
  - Estimated at 0.33 zetabytes each day (120 zetabytes annually).
  - 90% of the world's data was generated in just the past two years.

## Big Data
### 3. Value
  - Refers to the *worth* of data in decision-making.
  - Emphasizes the need to quickly identify and process relevant data.
  - Users may be able to find more patterns and interesting anomalies from "big" data than from "small" data.




## Big Data
### 4. Veracity
- Measures the *quality* of the data.
- Considers accuracy, completeness, and currency of data.
- Determines if the data can be *trusted* for good decision-making.



## Big Data
### 5. Variety

<div style="text-align: center; width: 55%; margin: auto;">

  <p style="font-weight: bold;"> </p>
</div>

   - Data comes in various formats.
   - **Structured data**: Has a predefined format, fits into traditional databases.
   - **Unstructured data**: Not organized in a predefined manner, comes from sources like documents, social media, emails, photos, videos, etc.

### Introduction to Hadoop

<div style="text-align: center; width: 55%; margin: auto;">
  <img src="https://bcdanl.github.io/lec_figs/hadoop.png" style="width: 100%; margin-bottom: -20px;">
  <p style="font-weight: bold;"> </p>
</div>

- **Definition**
  - An open-source software framework for storing and processing large data sets.
- **Components**
  - **Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS):** Distributed data storage.
  - **MapReduce:** Data processing model.


## Hadoop
### Introduction to Hadoop

  <p style="font-weight: bold;"> </p>
</div>

- **Purpose**
  - Enables distributed processing of large data sets across clusters of computers.



## Hadoop
### Hadoop Architecture - HDFS

  <p style="font-weight: bold;"> </p>

::: {.column width="50%"}

- **HDFS**
  - Divides data into blocks and distributes them across different servers for processing.
  - Provides a highly redundant computing environment
    - Allows the application to keep running even if individual servers fail.


:::

## Hadoop
### Hadoop Architecture - MapReduce

- **MapReduce**
  - **Map Phase:** Filters and sorts data.
    - e.g., Sorting customer orders based on their product IDs, with each group corresponding to a specific product ID.
  - **Reduce Phase:** Summarizes and aggregates results.
    - e.g., Counting the number of orders within each group, thereby determining the frequency of each product ID.

  <p style="font-weight: bold;"> </p>

## Hadoop
### How Hadoop Works

1. **Data Distribution**
   - Large data sets are split into smaller blocks.
2. **Data Storage**
   - Blocks are stored across multiple servers in the cluster.
3. **Processing with MapReduce**
   - **Map Tasks:** Executed on servers where data resides, minimizing data movement.
   - **Reduce Tasks:** Combine results from map tasks to produce final output.
4. **Fault Tolerance**
   - Data replication ensures processing continues even if servers fail.


## Hadoop
### Extending Hadoop for Real-Time Processing

- **Limitation of Hadoop**
  - Hadoop is originally designed for batch processing.
    - **Batch Processing:** Data or tasks are collected over a period of time and then processed all at once, typically at scheduled times or during periods of low activity.
    - Results come after the entire dataset is analyzed.

- **Real-Time Processing Limitation:**
  - Hadoop cannot natively process real-time streaming data (e.g., stock prices flowing into stock exchanges, live sensor data)

- **Extending Hadoop's Capabilities**
  - Both Apache Storm and Apache Spark can run on top of Hadoop clusters, utilizing HDFS for storage.

## Hadoop
### Apache Storm and Apache Spark

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}

#### **Apache Storm**

- **Functionality:**
  - Processes real-time data streams.
  - Handles unbounded streams of data reliably and efficiently.
- **Use Cases:**
  - Real-time analytics
  - Online machine learning
  - Continuous computation
  - Real-time data integration

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

#### **Apache Spark**

- **Functionality:**
  - Provides *in-memory computations* for increased speed.
  - Supports both batch and streaming data processing through Spark Streaming.
- **Use Cases:**
  - Interactive queries for quick, on-the-fly data analysis
  - Machine learning
