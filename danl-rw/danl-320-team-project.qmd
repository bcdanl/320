# Presentation

Each team will deliver a 15-20-minute presentation, followed by a 1–2 minute Q&A session:

- The order of team presentations will be determined by a random draw during the last class.
  -	If multiple teams choose the same topic, I will try to schedule these teams separately to minimize repetition within a presentation session.
-	To ensure fairness and equal participation, **each student must contribute evenly** to the presentation. 
- **New Techniques**: If your presentation content involves data transformation, visualizations, or statistical analysis not covered in class, your team must provide a brief explanation of the code for those contents during the presentation.


## Submission
- Each team must email the **presentation slides** (in _Microsoft PowerPoint_ or _Google Slides_ format) for the project by May 13, 2025, Tuesday, 3:00 P.M. (Eastern Time)


## Data Transformation/Visualization Support
- Feel free to reach out to Byeong-Hak if you need guidance with data transformation/visualization tasks for your team project.

# Key Components in the Presentation

1. **Title:**
   - Pick a title that’s clear, catchy, and gives a good sense of what your project is about.

2. **Introduction:**
   - **Background:** Give some context about your topic and why it matters. Think of this as setting the stage for your data story and explaining what motivated you to dig into this topic.
   - **Statement of the Project Interest:** Spell out the problem or issue you’re tackling. This will help guide your data analysis and keep things focused.

3. **Data Storytelling:**
   - **Questions and Objectives:** List the questions you’re trying to answer. Use these to shape your story and show how your data insights relate to real-world problems.
   - **Data Transformation and Descriptive Statistics:** Walk your audience through your findings, weaving together data transformations and stats to highlight the big takeaways. Explain how your data transformations bring out the important stuff.
   - **Data Visualization:** Use clear visuals that fit right into your narrative. Each visual should highlight key insights, moving your story forward. Make sure they are easy to interpret and add value to your story.
   - **Machine Learning Analysis:** Present the results of your machine learning models clearly and concisely. Explain what the results mean in the context of your research questions and how they support (or challenge) your key insights. Focus on interpreting the findings rather than just reporting numbers.

4. **Significance of the Project:**
   - Talk about why your findings matter. How can they be used in the real world, influence business decisions, or inform public policy? Connect your data analysis to broader themes and show why it’s relevant.

5. **Visual Materials and Slide Quality:**
   - Keep your slides clean, visually appealing, and easy to follow. Good visuals and a smart layout will make your story more engaging.
   - Your slides will be judged on how clear and effective they are, and how well they pull everything together.

6. **Team Presentation:**
   - Make sure your presentation is engaging and flows well. Everyone on the team should contribute, showing a solid grasp of the project while keeping the audience interested.
   - We’ll be looking at how well you deliver, how organized your presentation is, and how clearly you explain your ideas.

7. **References:**
   - List all your sources properly and make sure your citations are consistent and complete. Give credit where it’s due!

# Peer Evaluation

-	You are required to evaluate **your peers’ presentations** (excluding your own team members). Peer evaluations will account for 10% of the total project score.
  - An Excel spreadsheet for the peer evaluation will be provided. Make sure to save the spreadsheet and submit it to Brightspace.
  - Failure to complete the peer evaluation will result in a reduction of your class participation score.
  - **Score Calculation**: For each category of **Presentation Rubric 1-6**, the highest and lowest scores will be dropped to ensure fairness when calculating the peer evaluation score.
